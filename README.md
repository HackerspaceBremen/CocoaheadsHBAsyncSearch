CocoaheadsHBAsyncSearch
=======================

An iOS demo project showing two ways of doing **async search** while typing in a UITextField. Doing live searching once with standard Grand Central Dispatch calls and once with NSOperations. You can easily compare and see how it's done.

This project was the result of a discussion in **CocoaHeads Bremen**.
